## âš™ What tools and languages do I use ?

I mainly use Python, but I'll also use C, R, ... or other depending on what I'm doing :)


## ðŸŒ± What am I currently learning ?

I discovered the fabulous world of CTF recently, so I am working on subjects that could help me achieve a greater level :) In a similar subject, but not always related to CTFs, I am learning about OSINT !
